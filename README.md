In this thesis, heat transfer in reciprocating-type compressors is modelled, which is of 
relevance due to its applicability to hydrogen gas storage. This is of great interest in 
facilitating the energy transition. This work contains and shows an overview of the 
technical literature, along with equations of the heat loss models proposed by a few 
scholars, namely Annand, Woschni, Adair, Disconzi, and Aigner. Detailed 
information on the implementation of these models in MATLAB, using the REFPROP 
library to obtain fluid properties, is presented. Later, preliminary results from the 
simulations are compared with the literature models, to assess the validity of the 
current model implementation, in a small reciprocating-piston compressor for 
refrigeration applications. The working fluids analysed are R134a, carbon dioxide, and 
dry air. A case study on a larger hydrogen reciprocating-piston compressor is then 
presented, with a parametric analysis performed on the wall temperature. It is 
ascertained that heat transfer in compressors requires consideration, although its effect 
is small compared to the power required for compression.
